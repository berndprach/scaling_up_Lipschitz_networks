# Scaling Up Lipschitz Networks
In this repository we provide code and results for our recent project, *Scaling Up Lipschitz Networks*,
where we explored how scaling up training data and training time effects the performance of standard
1-Lipschitz models.

## Introduction

Plenty of recent work has shown that additional training data greatly improves robust classification accuracy.
